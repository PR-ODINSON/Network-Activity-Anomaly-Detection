A model to predict whether a network is experiencing "normal" activity or "neptune" activity

# Network Attack Detection

This project develops a Random Forest Classifier to detect network attacks using a dataset with various traffic statistics. The model aims to classify network traffic as either an attack or normal based on different features.

## Dataset
- `train_data.csv`: Contains the training data with features and target variable `attack`.
- `test_data.csv`: Contains the test data with features only.
